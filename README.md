# jupyter-hpcc

## Introduction
%%hpcc magic for jupyter/ipython notebooks (http://jupyter.org/), aiming to mesh data science through HPCC (http://hpccsystems.com) with exploration through Jupyter notebooks.

Allows HPCC's ECL to be run in each Jupyter cell

Local python variables can be bound to placeholders in ECL

Allows polygot development of solutions using ECL along with python and any other embedded languages in one Jupyter notebook.
e.g. Transform your data at scale with HPCC using ECL then visualise the results using Python and matplotlib

## TODO
* integrate with hpcc visualisation library
* allow easy ingestion of data
